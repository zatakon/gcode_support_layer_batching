Post-processor for multi-material G-code that optimizes support printing by batching consecutive layers when geometrically safe.

## Overview

This tool analyzes multi-material G-code and intelligently groups consecutive layers of the same material (support or primary) when:
- The nozzle won't collide with existing printed geometry
- Future layer geometry won't interfere with the nozzle path

### Key Innovation

Instead of alternating between materials every layer (causing frequent tool changes), this processor batches multiple consecutive layers of the same material together - dramatically reducing tool changes and print time while maintaining print quality.

## Features

- **🎯 Layer Batching**: Groups multiple consecutive layers of the same material to reduce tool changes
- **🔍 Collision Detection**: Analyzes nozzle geometry (E3D v6: 60° cone) vs. printed part geometry to ensure safe batching
- **⬆️ Z-hop Insertion**: Adds Z-hop moves when traveling over already-printed layers
- **🖼️ Per-Color Prime Towers**: Each material gets its own prime tower for better synchronization
- **🔧 Configurable Parameters**: Adjust collision margins, batch sizes, Z-hop heights, etc.

## Architecture

### Core Components

1. **`gcode_parser.py`**: Reads and parses G-code, identifying layers and tool changes (T0/T1 commands)
2. **`collision_detector.py`**: Determines if nozzle can safely print multiple layers without hitting printed geometry
3. **`layer_batcher.py`**: Groups consecutive layers of the same material when collision-free
4. **`zhop_manager.py`**: Inserts appropriate Z-hop moves for travel moves
5. **`prime_tower.py`**: Manages separate prime towers for each material
6. **`gcode_processor.py`**: Main application that integrates all components

### Nozzle Geometry

The collision detection uses E3D v6 nozzle specifications:
- **Cone angle**: 60° (as shown in the reference diagram)
- **Tip diameter**: Configurable (default 0.4mm)
- **Height**: 10mm conical section

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/zatakon/gcode_support_layer_batching.git
cd gcode_support_layer_batching
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

> [!WARNING]
> Always inspect the output G-code before sending to your printer. Start with small test prints.

### Basic Usage

```bash
python gcode_processor.py input.gcode output.gcode
```

### With Custom Parameters

```bash
python gcode_processor.py input.gcode output.gcode \
  --zhop 0.8 \
  --collision-margin 1.5 \
  --max-batch-layers 15
```

### All Parameters

```bash
python gcode_processor.py input.gcode output.gcode \
  --zhop FLOAT              # Z-hop height in mm (default: 0.5)
  --collision-margin FLOAT  # Safety margin for collision detection (default: 1.0)
  --nozzle-diameter FLOAT   # Nozzle diameter in mm (default: 0.4)
  --max-batch-layers INT    # Maximum layers to batch (default: 10)
  --disable-prime-towers    # Disable per-tool prime towers
```

## How It Works

### 1. Parse G-code
Read the input file and identify:
- Layer boundaries (Z height changes)
- Tool changes (T0, T1, etc.)
- Extrusion moves and geometry

### 2. Build Spatial Map
Create a voxel-based representation of printed geometry per layer for efficient collision queries.

### 3. Analyze Collisions
For each potential batch:
1. Calculate nozzle radius at the height difference between layers
2. Check if nozzle would collide with any intermediate geometry
3. Apply safety margin for robustness

### 4. Batch Layers
Group consecutive layers of the same tool when collision analysis confirms safety.

### 5. Insert Z-hops
When moving between non-consecutive layers, insert:
1. Z-hop up (lift nozzle)
2. XY travel at safe height
3. Z-hop down to destination layer

### 6. Manage Prime Towers
- Each tool gets a dedicated prime tower
- Towers are synchronized to prevent height mismatches
- Purge volume calculated per tool change

### 7. Output Optimized G-code
Write the new G-code with batched layers, Z-hops, and synchronized prime towers.

## Example Results

> [!NOTE]
> These are theoretical results. Actual performance will vary and needs real-world testing.

**Before Optimization:**
- 20 layers alternating between support (T1) and primary (T0)
- Result: ~20 tool changes
- Print time: ~4 hours

**After Optimization:**
- Layers 1-10: Support material batched (T1)
- Layers 11-20: Primary material batched (T0)
- Result: 2 tool changes (95% reduction!)
- Print time: ~2.5 hours (38% faster)

## Testing

Run the included test example:

```bash
python test_example.py
```

This generates a test G-code file with alternating materials and processes it to demonstrate the optimization.

**Testing Checklist:**
- [ ] Test with simple geometry first
- [ ] Verify output G-code syntax
- [ ] Check layer heights are correct
- [ ] Inspect tool changes and Z-hops
- [ ] Validate prime tower positions
- [ ] Test on actual printer with non-critical print
- [ ] Monitor first few layers closely

## Advanced Configuration

### Collision Detection Tuning

```python
from collision_detector import CollisionDetector, NozzleGeometry

# Custom nozzle geometry
nozzle = NozzleGeometry(
    diameter=0.4,      # Nozzle tip diameter
    cone_angle=60.0,   # E3D v6 = 60°, some nozzles = 40°
    height=10.0        # Height of conical section
)

detector = CollisionDetector(
    nozzle=nozzle,
    safety_margin=1.5  # Increase for more conservative batching
)
```

### Prime Tower Positioning

```python
from prime_tower import PrimeTowerConfig

config = PrimeTowerConfig(
    enabled=True,
    tower_size=10.0,        # mm per side
    tower_spacing=5.0,      # mm between towers
    position_x=200.0,       # X position for first tower
    position_y=200.0,       # Y position for all towers
    purge_volume=30.0       # mm³ to purge per tool change
)
```

## Limitations

- **Voxel Resolution**: Collision detection uses 0.5mm voxels for efficiency. Very fine details may require tuning.
- **Simple Geometry**: Works best with straightforward part geometries. Complex overhangs may need manual review.
- **Support Patterns**: Optimized for grid/linear support patterns. Organic supports may have different characteristics.
- **Untested Code**: This is AI-generated code without real-world validation. Use at your own risk.

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- NumPy for geometric calculations
- Shapely for advanced collision detection (optional)
